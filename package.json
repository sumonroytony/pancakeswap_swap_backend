  "description": "## Purpose This bot is a fork of an existing bot that I was trying to help my group with. After spending hours providing technical support to help them run it, I decided to fork it and update it to make it easier to use. No dependencies, nothing to install. Just download the bot for your operating system, create the \".env\" file, and pass in the token you want to snipe in the command line.  I have tried my best to make this as simple and easy to do so that anyone can use it without being a computer expert.",
